## What is the National Tech Committee?

Good question! The DSA National Tech Committee (NTC) is a collection of volunteer tech-workers from across the country. We research and implement tech solutions to meet the various needs of DSAâ€™s national leadership and local chapters, particularly with respect to collaboration and communication.

## Can the NTC help my chapter, committee, or working group with a project?

Sure can do! We love making tools for our comrades. Fill out our project help request form (link above) with the details of your situation and we will get back to you to discuss options. Note that because we are all volunteers, we might not necessarily have the capacity to help with every project idea.

## I'm having trouble with my account, can you help?

If you need to get access to the Discussion Forum, or forgot your password, visit the opt-in site via the link above. From there, you can input the email you used for your DSA membership, and should get a link to sign up or reset your password.

## I found a bug on a DSA website or want to request a new feature. Can I reach out for support?

Just fill out a ticket using the "Help Form" link above. Please note that we cannot make any promises to get around to fixing this issue quickly; we have limited capacity as a group and will try to review your request as soon as we can.

## My email, Slack, Wordpress, or Nintendo DS is broken... Can you help?

Unfortunately, the NTC does not currently accept requests for technical support. Maybe one day... but for now, we have limited resources and need to dedicate all our energy to building and maintaining digital infrastructure.

## I'm really interested in technology! How can I help?

Welcome aboard! Fill out our volunteer signup form to give us your contact info and skillset. We will get you onboarded into our communications and set you to work on a project ASAP!
