		<h2>What is the National Tech Committee?</h2>
		<p>Good question! The DSA National Tech Committee (NTC) is a collection of volunteer tech-workers from across the country. We research and implement tech solutions to meet the various needs of DSAâ€™s national leadership and local chapters, particularly with respect to collaboration and communication.</p>
		<h2>Can the NTC help my chapter, committee, or working group with a project?</h2>
		<p>Sure can do! We love making cool tools for our comrades. Fill out this project request google form with an explanation and we'll get back to you soon to set up a project timeline.</p>
		<h2>My email, slack, wordpress, or Nintendo DS is broken, can you help?</h2>
		<p>Nope! DSA-NTC currently <i>does not accept requests for technical support</i>. Maybe one day, but for now we have limited resources and need to dedicate all our energy to building and maintaining digital infrastructure.</p>
		<h2>I'm an 31it3 h4x0r, how can I help?</h2>
		<p>Welcome aboard! Sign up at this google form hyperlink, or reach out to us at our email hyperlink. We'll get you onboarded into our communications and set you to work on a project stat!<p>
